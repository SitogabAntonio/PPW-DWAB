# DWAB - ConnectHobby 

DWAB is an abbreviation of the names of our group members, namely D (Daniel), W (Weny), A (Antonio), B (Bintang). DWAB ConnectHobby is formed for students with similar hobbies to communicate quickly and efficiently.

The background of the development of this website lies in the fact that sometimes individuals find it challenging to connect with communities relevant to their interests. Therefore, this website can be an opportunity to bring together shared interests and skills. The goal of developing this website is also to support and facilitate the growth of individuals with similar interests and hobbies, helping them connect and grow together.
